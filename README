Welcome to elffile!

Elffile is a pure python implementation of a library which reads and
writes ELF format object files
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format>.

Elffile has been tested on python versions 2.[67] and 3.[012].

As I'm trying to straddle the 2 vs 3 jump, I'm relying on some of the
python-3 compatibility features from 2.6 and higher.  Supporting
earlier versions of python would be possible, but would make
supporting the python 2 vs 3 straddle somewhat more difficult.  I've
arbitrarily drawn my line in the sand at 2.6.
